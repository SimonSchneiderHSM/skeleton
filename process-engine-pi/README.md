# ProcessEngineJS Skeleton PI

This is a Server that provides a process-engine-instance for a raspberry pi

## What are the goals of this project?

The goal is to provide a minimal starting point for creating a ProcessEngine-Instance, that works on the Raspberry PI and interacts with some GPIO-Devices

### Requirements

- Node >= `6.2.1`
- Raspberry PI 3

### Setup/Installation

This guide was written on the 28.09.2017 for raspbian stretch lite

Install [raspbian lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) as it is described on the website.

#### Configure Language and SSH

activate ssh, enable i2c, set language and rename the pi through raspi-config
```
sudo raspi-config
```
- select `Interfacing Options` -> `SSH` -> `Yes` -> `Ok`
- select `Interfacing Options` -> `I2C` -> `Yes` -> `Ok` (this is necessary to use smbu)
- select `Localisation Options` -> `Change Locale` -> Select your Locale (e.g. `de_DE.UTF-8 UTF-8`) -> `Ok` -> Select system-locale (e.g. `de_DE.UTF-8`)
- select `Localisation Options` -> `Change Keyboard Layout` -> Select the correct layout -> `Ok` -> Select the correct language -> `OK` -> Select the correct variant
- select `Hostname` -> `Ok` -> enter a new name -> `Ok`
- choose `yes` when asked if you want to reboot

#### Setup WIfi

create `/etc/network/interfaces.d/wifi` with the following content:
```
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet manual
wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
iface default inet dhcp
```

create/update the file `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf` with the following content:
```
network={
  ssid="yourssid"
  psk="yourpassword"
}
```
reboot

get the PIs IP-Address:
```
ifconfig wlan0
```
remeber that IP address. From now on, use ssh to access the pi as this is easier. alternatively you should be able to use the PIs hostname as address, e.g. `ssh pi@bpmn-pi`

#### Update the OS
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

install screen and python-smbus:
```
sudo apt-get install screen python-smbus
```

#### Install node
*see [installing nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)*

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.4/install.sh | bash
exit
```

reconnect to the pi
```
nvm install 7
```

#### Setup the Process-Engine
- copy this folder (process-engine-pi) to your pi
- ssh into your pi, move into the folder you just copied
- if the process-engine isn't public yet, login with `npm login` to gain access to the process-engine-packages
- install the necessary dependencies with
```bash
npm install
```
- set the ip of the machine with the Database in `config/development/data_sources/postgres.json`
- set the ip of the messagebus-master as `endPointName` in `config/development/messagebus/faye.json`, e.g. `http://192.168.161.20:8000/mb`. Also set `isMaster` to false in the same file

#### Make the process-engine autostart on boot
see *[this tutorial](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-automatically-execute-shell-script-at-startup-boot-on-systemd-linux)* and *[this tutorial](https://gist.github.com/joepie91/73ce30dd258296bd24af23e9c5f761aa)*

create the file `/etc/systemd/system/process-engine.service` with the following content:
```
[Unit]
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=forking
User=pi
Environment=NODE_VERSION=7
ExecStart=/usr/bin/screen -dmL process-engine.log -S process-engine /home/pi/.nvm/nvm-exec npm start --prefix /home/pi/process-engine-pi

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
*(change the username, node-version, logfile-name, screen-name and/or project-path if necessary)*

install the systemd-service:
```
sudo chmod 664 /etc/systemd/system/process-engine.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable process-engine.service
```

## How do I use this project?

### Usage

To Start the process-engine-instance manually, run
```bash
npm start
```

With autostart setup, you probably don't need to do this though.
