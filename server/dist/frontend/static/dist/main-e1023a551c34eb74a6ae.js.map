Does not clone if nothing changed.\n * - `visit(child, state)`: Processes the child node, calling the appropriate\n *   `visit{Field,Fragment,Root` method based on the node type.\n *\n * All of these methods may return the original node in order to leave it\n * intact.\n *\n * @see RelayQueryVisitor\n */\n\nvar RelayQueryTransform = function (_RelayQueryVisitor) {\n  (0, _inherits3['default'])(RelayQueryTransform, _RelayQueryVisitor);\n\n  function RelayQueryTransform() {\n    (0, _classCallCheck3['default'])(this, RelayQueryTransform);\n    return (0, _possibleConstructorReturn3['default'])(this, _RelayQueryVisitor.apply(this, arguments));\n  }\n\n  RelayQueryTransform.prototype.traverse = function traverse(node, nextState) {\n    if (!node.canHaveSubselections()) {\n      return node;\n    }\n    var nextChildren = void 0;\n    this.traverseChildren(node, nextState, function (child, index, children) {\n      var prevChild = children[index];\n      var nextChild = this.visit(prevChild, nextState);\n      if (nextChild !== prevChild) {\n        nextChildren = nextChildren || children.slice(0, index);\n      }\n      if (nextChildren && nextChild) {\n        nextChildren.push(nextChild);\n      }\n    }, this);\n    if (nextChildren) {\n      if (!nextChildren.length) {\n        return null;\n      }\n      return node.clone(nextChildren);\n    }\n    return node;\n  };\n\n  return RelayQueryTransform;\n}(require('./RelayQueryVisitor'));\n\nmodule.exports = RelayQueryTransform;\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/react-relay/lib/RelayQueryTransform.js\n// module id = 123\n// module chunks = 0","/**\n * Copyright (c) 2013-present, Facebook, Inc.\n * All rights reserved.\n *\n * This source code is licensed under the BSD-style license found in the\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.

Precise rendering behavior is configured via the `render` prop\n * which takes a callback.\n *\n * The container created using `Relay.createContainer` must be supplied via the\n * `Container` prop, and the query configuration that conforms to the shape of a\n * `RelayQueryConfig` must be supplied via the `queryConfig` prop.\n *\n * === Render Callback ===\n *\n * The `render` callback is called with an object with the following properties:\n *\n *   props: ?{[propName: string]: mixed}\n *     If present, sufficient data is ready to render the container. This object\n *     must be spread into the container using the spread attribute operator. If\n *     absent, there is insufficient data to render the container.\n *\n *   done: boolean\n *     Whether all data dependencies have been fulfilled. If `props` is present\n *     but `done` is false, then sufficient data is ready to render, but some\n *     data dependencies have not yet been fulfilled.\n *\n *   error: ?Error\n *     If present, an error occurred while fulfilling data dependencies. If\n *     `props` and `error` are both present, then sufficient data is ready to\n *     render, but an error occurred while fulfilling deferred dependencies.\n *\n *   retry: ?Function\n *     A function that can be called to re-attempt to fulfill data dependencies.\n *     This property is only present if an `error` has occurred.\n *\n *   stale: boolean\n *     When `forceFetch` is enabled, a request is always made to fetch updated\n *     data. However, if all data dependencies can be immediately fulfilled, the\n *     `props` property will be present. In this case, `stale` will be true.\n *\n * The `render` callback can return `undefined` to continue rendering the last\n * view rendered (e.g. when transitioning from one `queryConfig` to another).\n *\n * If a `render` callback is not supplied, the default behavior is to render the\n * container if data is available, the existing view if one exists, or nothing.\n *\n * === Refs ===\n *\n * References to elements rendered by the `render` callback can be obtained by\n * using the React `ref` prop. For example:\n *\n *   <FooComponent {...props} ref={handleFooRef} />\n *\n *   function handleFooRef(component) {\n *     // Invoked when `<FooComponent>` is mounted or unmounted. When mounted,\n *     // `component` will be the component.

For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n   *\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n   *\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n   *\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n   *\n   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n   *\n   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n   *\n   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n   *\n   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n   *     }\n   *\n   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   */\n  function is(valueA, valueB) {\n    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n        return true;\n      }\n      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n        return false;\n      }\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\n        valueA.equals(valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  function deepEqual(a, b) {\n    if (a === b) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    if (\n      !isIterable(b) ||\n      a.size !== undefined && b.size !== undefined && a.size !== b.size ||\n      a.__hash !== undefined && b.__hash !== undefined && a.__hash !== b.__hash ||\n      isKeyed(a) !== isKeyed(b) ||\n      isIndexed(a) !== isIndexed(b) ||\n      isOrdered(a) !== isOrdered(b)\n    ) {\n      return false;\n    }\n\n    if (a.size === 0 && b.size === 0) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    var notAssociative = !isAssociative(a);\n\n    if (isOrdered(a)) {\n      var entries = a.entries();\n      return b.every(function(v, k)  {\n        var entry = entries.next().value;\n        return entry && is(entry[1], v) && (notAssociative || is(entry[0], k));\n      }) && entries.next().done;\n    }\n\n    var flipped = false;\n\n    if (a.size === undefined) {\n      if (b.size === undefined) {\n        if (typeof a.cacheResult === 'function') {\n          a.cacheResult();\n        }\n      } else {\n        flipped = true;\n        var _ = a;\n        a = b;\n        b = _;\n      }\n    }\n\n    var allEqual = true;\n    var bSize = b.__iterate(function(v, k)  {\n      if (notAssociative ? !a.has(v) :\n          flipped ? !is(v, a.get(k, NOT_SET)) : !is(a.get(k, NOT_SET), v)) {\n        allEqual = false;\n        return false;\n      }\n    });\n\n    return allEqual && a.size === bSize;\n  }\n\n  createClass(Repeat, IndexedSeq);\n\n    function Repeat(value, times) {\n      if (!(this instanceof Repeat)) {\n        return new Repeat(value, times);\n      }\n      this._value = value;\n      this.size = times === undefined ?
