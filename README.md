# ProcessEngineJS Skeleton

This is is a Database, process-engine-instance and web-ui to edit process-models

## What are the goals of this project?

This Project has two goals:
1. provide a minimal starting point for creating a ProcessEngine
2. provide the minimal implementation necessary to run the reservation-demo

### Requirements

See
- [database-requirements](database/README.md#requirements)
- If you want to use the minmal skeleton, see [process-engine-server-requirements](process-engine-server/README.md#requirements). If you want to use the reservation-demo, see [process-engine-server-demo-requirements](process-engine-server-demo/README.md#requirements)
- if you want to use the pi, see the [process-engine-pi-requirements](process-engine-pi/README.md#requirements)
- [frontend-requirements](https://github.com/5minds/charon#voraussetzungen)

### Setup/Installation

- start a database as described in the [database-setup](database/README.md#setup)
- if you use the minimal skeleton, setup the process-engine-server-instance as described in the [server-setup](process-engine-server/README.md#setupinstallation). If you use the demo-skeleton, setup the process-engine-server-demo-instance as described in the [server-demo-setup](process-engine-server/README.md#setupinstallation)
- If you want to use the pi, setup the process-engine-pi-instance as described in the  [pi-setup](process-engine-pi/README.md#setupinstallation)
- clone the [charon-frontend](https://github.com/5minds/charon) and follow its [setup-guide](https://github.com/5minds/charon#setupinstallation)


## How do I use this project?

### Usage

- you don't really need to do anything with the DB. if you want to anyway, see the [database-usage](database/README.md#usage)
- if you use the minimal skeleton, start the process-engine-server-instance as described in the [server-usage](process-engine-server/README.md#usage). If you use the demo-skeleton, start the process-engine-server-demo-instance as described in the [server-demo-setup](process-engine-server/README.md#setupinstallation)
- If you want to use the pi, start the process-engine-pi-instance as described in the [pi-usage](process-engine-pi/README.md#usage)
- start the charon-frontend as desribed in its [usage-guide](https://github.com/5minds/charon#wie-kann-ich-das-projekt-benutzen)

## What else is there to know?

### Workarounds

There are still some bugs in the process engine. Because of this, There are a few workarounds applied to the process-engine-server-demo. See [server-demo-workarounds](process-engine-server-demo/README.md#workarounds) for detailed info.
